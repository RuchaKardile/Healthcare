## Healthcare Data Analysis: Patient Waitlist Tracking and Trend Insights (2018–2021)

The healthcare data project aims to analyze and track patient waitlists for outpatient, inpatient, and day case categories, with data spanning 2018–2021. The goals include monitoring the current waitlist status, analyzing historical trends by month, and providing detailed specialty and age-level insights. Key metrics are the average and median waitlists, along with the current total waitlist. Data columns include Archive_Date (snapshot date), Specialty_HIPE (specialty code), Speciality (medical department), Adult_Child (patient age category), Age_Profile (age group), Time_Bands (wait duration), and Total (patient count). The project will feature both a summary page and a detailed view for granular analysis.
